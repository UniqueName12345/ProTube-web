# ProTube-web
An open source project that allows you to watch videos from YouTube and Odysee.

## Features
It is 90% spyware free. It is written in [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) and [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML).

## Installation
You can either host the project yourself or go to:
https://www.protube-web.github.io/index.html

## Hosting yourself
In order to host the project yourself, you have to know your IP address. You can find it by typing `ifconfig` in a terminal if you are on linux, or `ipconfig` in a terminal if you are on windows. If you are using ipconfig, the IP address will be in the section `IPv4 Address`.

Once you have your IP address, you have to download a program called [wget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wget).

Then you can type the following command in a terminal:
`
wget -O index.html https://www.protube-web.github.io/index.html
`
And repeat the same for the other files.

Then buy a domain name (usually $5 or $10) and go to the domain name you just bought. You should see a message saying that the domain name is bought, but it is empty.

You can now browse to the domain name renter's file system. You can find the index.html file in the root directory. Replace every file with the one you downloaded.

You have successfully hosted the project yourself!

## Credits
This project was inspired by [Vanced](https://www.vancedapp.com/) which was a project similar to this, but without the Odysee support, with a lot of other features and is on android. But that project was discontinued.
